      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This is a great recipe for easy shredded chicken tacos that I've been using for years. Great for a weeknight or a weekend meal!</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
<li>¼ cup water/li>
<li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
<li>2 (8 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
<li>2 teaspoons white distilled vinegar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>½ teaspoon white sugar/li>
<li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
<li>8 taco shells, warmed</li>
</ul>
 <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
  <li>Mix water and taco seasoning in a large bowl. Add tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, oregano, cumin, and sugar; mix well.
  </li>
  <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Add tomato sauce mixture and bring to a boil. 
   Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes.
   An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
  <li>Remove chicken breasts from the pan and shred meat with 2 forks when cool enough to handle.
Return shredded chicken to the pan with the tomato sauce. Cook and stir until chicken is coated with sauce and sauce reduces a bit, about 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl and spoon onto taco shells.</li>    
</ol>
